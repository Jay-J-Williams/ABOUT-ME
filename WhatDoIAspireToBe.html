									<p>Software engineering is my ideal job because it connects creativity and logic in a brilliant way. I love the thought of learning many different programming languages and paradigms to create and improve new software. I would love to work on applications that can change the world for the better or, make someone’s life a little easier. As I’ve been working with Python during the introduction to programming subject, I’ve seen software build very similarly to how a game builds. The difference between the two is minor, games show the building progression like a jigsaw puzzle whereas other software, builds in a mostly linear fashion. Watching the game, I was creating start to piece together was one of my favourite parts of developing it and, building software gives me the same feeling. A feeling of excitement, a feeling of discovery.</p>
									<p>The qualification I would need to get is a computer science degree, or a degree from a related field (IT, software engineering). Some roles may prefer a master’s degree or PHD in one of these areas, but it is unnecessary for most jobs in the field. I would also need a variety of skills, these include fluency in multiple programming languages, multiple programming paradigms and excellent written and verbal communication skills. I will gain the qualification needed by completing the bachelor of IT at RMIT. I intend to gain many of the skills that I may not learn during the course through literature and online courses. I plan on learning various programming languages in different paradigms to increase my chances of receiving a software engineering role. While I am at RMIT I will learn Python, Java and C++ through the degree but, I would also like to learn at least 2 other programming languages myself. I also intend to do an internship during my time at RMIT, likely in software development. An internship would give me crucial work experience in a similar role to the one I would like to pursue. Currently, I have few skills in software engineering but, I can build upon my skills in Python, and my skills as a game design student to gain the skills I need to master such an interesting role. I intend to continue my Python skill development past the introduction to programming subject so that I can become a more skilled and efficient programmer. My time as a game design student was very applicable to software engineering as many similar skills are required. For example, as a game design student, I was enrolled in 2 design subjects which are applicable skills to each field. My basic skills will build into advanced skills that will help me transition into the amazing field of software engineering. I am excited to put the pieces of the puzzle together, so that I can build the picture I dream of, a career in software engineering.</p>
