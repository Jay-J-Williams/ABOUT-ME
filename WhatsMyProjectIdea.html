										<h1>What's my Project Idea?</h1>
									</header>
									<p>Imagine walking through a futuristic spaceship that is crawling with various types of dangerous aliens, armed with only your pistol. Fighting wave after wave of aliens who attack you in different ways. A race may use their speed, power, or stealth to attack you, but whatever method of attack the alien race uses, there will be another race in the next room who will have a different fighting style, always keeping you on your toes. Just when you think that the fight will be over, an alien race’s leader breaks in and makes things even more difficult. This is the feeling my project idea captures.</p>
									<p>This project would help a multitude of people, fans of sci-fi, fans of dungeon crawlers, people who are stuck inside because of COVID, casual gamers, old school gamers and fans of retro-style games. Entertainment is crucial in the epidemic we are currently in, sometimes all we need is a fun distraction to help us realise that life isn’t as dull as it seems. This game would be free-to-play, so that anyone can give it a go and have a great time while doing so. Clairfield International claims that 85% of the revenue the gaming industry earnt in 2019, was from free-to-play games. They also claim that the free-to-play PC game market revenue worldwide rose to $21.3 billion in 2019. People often say, “the best things in life are free”, and what is better than free entertainment during a stressful time.</p>
									<p>The game takes place on the international space station in the year 2222, aliens from different planets have formed an alliance to take over the international space station and eventually, destroy humanity. The only thing standing in between the aliens and the end of humanity is you. Beginning the game armed with only your trusty sidearm, you are to kill every alien on the ship, and their leaders. The game features five different races of aliens each with unique abilities and fighting styles, each one with a deadly leader. The game is a sci-fi adaptation of the dungeon crawler genre. This genre is usually known for it’s links with the fantasy genre but, I think it will work provide gamers with a much-needed change of scenery when combined with the sci-fi genre. As you progress through the space station, the enemies will grow more difficult. The variation in fighting styles is also sure to keep you on your toes. Some alien races will primarily use their agility to fight you, some will primarily use brute force, some will primarily use stealth but, they will all use a combination of these attributes in their attempts to defeat you. The good news is that you will find various new weapons along the way, from futuristic shotguns to energy swords, you can find many different weapons to aid your fight against the alien alliance. You will find these weapons as you defeat the hordes of aliens, the more you defeat, the better the weapons available to you will be. As you play you will earn digital currency, this can be exchanged for unique player skins, power-ups or experience points. The digital currency will be crucial to your survival when playing on the hardest difficulties. The power-ups you can buy with it will provide you with weapons, extra health and abilities. The abilities will include but not be limited to, overcharging your weapon for extra damage, med-kits to heal yourself, and an invisibility cloaking device to hide you from the hordes. The unique player skins will give you a greater sense of personalisation. You will be able to make your player male or female and, you will have many different outfits, helmets, and colours to choose from, making the experience more tailored to you as a player. Experience points can either be earned by playing the game or, they can be bought with digital currency. Experience points provide a progression system and, you can earn skins and power-ups by leveling up your player. These are different to the ones you can find in the store. The game will also feature various difficulty settings, so people can have a casual experience or a challenge. Another feature is the birds-eye-view, enabling you to see aliens from every possible direction, aiding your battle to victory over the alien alliance. The story develops as you defeat each race of aliens and their leaders, until the story rises to the point of climax. During the climax, it is revealed that the leader of the alliance is someone that you have been fighting for the whole time. Then, you must defeat the leader in the final battle of the game.</p>
									<p>The game will be developed in Python using Pygame. The Pygame wiki claims that is an open-source tool, which is crucial to the development of games created in the Python programming language. It’s a set of Python modules designed for developing videogames. The hardware requirements for the game will be very low, any computer created after 2010 should run the game without any issues. All you will need to play the game, is a computer, a mouse and a keyboard. To run the game, you just need to open the .exe file and you can play right away. This project is made with minimal hardware requirements so that nearly anyone with a computer can have some fun on the game.</p>
									<p>The skills necessary to build this project are, Python, Pygame and 2D game art. The Python skills are feasible considering many of the people in my group are currently doing the introduction to programming subject. Our skills that we have learnt and will continue to learn in the subject will be applicable to this project. The Pygame skills are feasible because codecamp.org has a two-hour tutorial on YouTube, explaining how to use the tool. The tutorial should easily transition each group member into the tool’s applications and, provide us with the skills necessary. The 2D game art is feasible because I have art skills and, many of my other group members do as well. For 2D art we could do a range of different art styles but, the most logical style would be pixel art. Pixel art is known for being easy at it’s basic level and, there is a beginner’s crash course available on YouTube that has a run-time of twenty minutes.</p>
									<p>If this game is successful, it could make many people who are struggling with the current circumstances enjoy something, even just for a short period of time. It would make peoples’ lives a little bit brighter. It would provide the fans of sci-fi and dungeon crawlers a new and exciting game to explore, and they may even connect with one-another over the game. Casual gamers would have something new to enjoy, retro players would have a classic-style game with innovation implemented and, old school gamers will have something that reminds them of their favourite era of gaming. This game has something for everyone, and even if only a few people play it, it will still be successful in my eyes, because we would have made something that people enjoy.</p>
