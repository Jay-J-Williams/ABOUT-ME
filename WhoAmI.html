									<p>My name is Jay Meredith, and I study IT at RMIT. I hold a certificate III in retail and, I have also previously studied at JMC Academy while I was studying for my undergraduate certificate in Game Design and Animation. Game Design is a huge passion for me alongside many others. My primary passions include, Game Design, 3D art, and music. I expand upon each of these in the passions section.</p>
									<p>My favourite hobby that I’ve ever had was leading a competitive Counter Strike team. The progression I saw from my teammates was astronomical and, it was the hobby that made me discover my love for leadership roles. I’ve always been introverted but, when I’m passionate about something I become more extroverted. It was fun drawing up plays, thinking about what we were going to try during the next training session and, watching our growth as a team. The most rewarding part of leading the team was watching my teammates grow as players. I still marvel at the fact that many of these people were much older than me yet, they still respected me and wanted to learn from me. Upon reflection, it made me realise that I need to be humbler because the greatest advice could come from the strangest direction. Although I have stopped playing as often, many of my teammates still play (years later), and they recently messaged me about playing with them soon. I can’t wait to see how much they’ve grown since I’ve been gone. It was awesome to see that they named their new team after the original one. It made me feel proud, I’m blessed that I could make such a profound impact on each of them.</p>
